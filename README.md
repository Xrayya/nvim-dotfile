# My Neovim Config

- This config contains 44 plugins (will probably add more soon)
- LSP has been set up for several languages (java, html, css, js, cpp, etc)
- DAP has been set up for java and soon cpp

## TODO
- Consistent icon on all sections
- Customize lualine for better info
- Provide more documentation for `README`

## TODO (Experimental)
- Use nightly neovim version for inline virtual text
- Install [`lvimuser/lsp-inlayhints.nvim`](https://github.com/lvimuser/lsp-inlayhints.nvim/) in `anticonceal` branch for better inlayhints
