# My Neovim Config

- This config contains 65 plugins (will probably add more soon)
- LSP has been set up for several languages (Java, HTML, CSS, JS, CPP, etc.)
- DAP has been set up for Java and soon CPP

## To-do

- Provide more documentation for `README`
- Move `nvim-jdtls` config to `lua\plugins` directory using [@pavva91 configuration](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls/wiki/Sample-Configurations#pavva91-configuration)

## To-do (Experimental)

- Use nightly Neovim version for inline virtual text
