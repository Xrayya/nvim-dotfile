# My Neovim Config

- This config contains 65 plugins (will probably add more soon)
- LSP has been set up for several languages (java, html, css, js, cpp, etc)
- DAP has been set up for java and soon cpp

## TODO

- Provide more documentation for `README`
- Move `nvim-jdtls` config to `lua\plugins` directory using [@pavva91 cofiguration](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls/wiki/Sample-Configurations#pavva91-configuration)

## TODO (Experimental)

- Use nightly neovim version for inline virtual text
